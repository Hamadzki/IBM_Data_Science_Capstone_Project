# üöÄ SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

## üìú Project Overview
This capstone project is the final project of the **IBM Data Science** course. The goal of the project is to create a machine learning pipeline that predicts whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, thereby estimating the cost savings for a rocket launch.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, compared to other providers charging upwards of $165 million. The key to SpaceX's savings is the reuse of the first stage of the rocket. By predicting whether the first stage will land, we can provide insights to alternate companies bidding against SpaceX in future rocket launches.

## üîç Problem Statement
- What factors determine if the rocket's first stage will land successfully?
- How do various features interact to influence the success rate of the landing?
- What operational conditions are needed to ensure a successful landing program?
